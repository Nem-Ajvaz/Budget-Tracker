## Description

The Budget-Tracker is a web application that allows users to see and monitor their expenses. On payday or winning the lottery the user is able to add funds to their account and subtract when withdrawing. The graph shows the users history with withdraws and deposits. The application is usable offline by leveraging data cached during your last interactions with the app through PWAs (Progressive Web Apps).
